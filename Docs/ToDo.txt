MAKE A NEW BRANCH TO COMMIT ALL CHANGES TO! ✔️

1. Clean up data flow, separate into components
2. Make it work separated, and then make it work for all songs!

    DATA FLOW PLAN
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Have the same setup as before, divided into two screens. But instead of anchors, use a bar users can type into like the create post
Read the data from the input, send that to the get lyrics ✔️

Once both get lyrics have been triggered, then call the similarity query

- Have our get Lyrics component. Have two search bar components (left and right) that will call that function once the user submits. Once both
search boxes triggered, compare the similarities.

(What to do if both triggered? Should every new search trigger the API? Or maybe have a button that clears searches?)

Autocomplete search box?

    TO DO
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Remove all API keys from github (Repo is currently private. Maybe delete all to be safe or make new repo to be safe as this will be on portfolio)

- Get dot env working

- Once data is working and flowing, add some CSS flourish! Make it all animated and nice
    - Add loading animations while waiting for API
    - Style the page better, make it look cleaner
    - Animations to the form entry (text slides up when you click on it)

    DONE

    Need to fix the lyric searchup first and foremost! ✔️
    - Have data coming through from musixmatch, just need to display it now and then pass that data to dandelion once both results are in. ✔️
    - Display lyrics once they're loaded to the GetLyrics component! ✔️

    - Have the get lyrics working; now we need to query dandelion once we know that both lyrics have been searched for. Have it once left and right submitted are true,
      then we can query the similarities. Have something like <{LeftSubmitted && RightSubmitted} && SimilarityQuery/> in the HTMl return ✔️

    - Get Dandelion text similarity query to work all the time. ✔️
